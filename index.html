        <h1>MY FAVOURITE BAND</h1>
        <p>My favourite band is <strong>Little Mix</strong>.Little Mix is one of the finest girl band and probably everyone's favorite.Its based in Britain.It consist of four very pretty girls.They mainly deal with the <em>pop genre</em> in music.Little mix was formed on <em>X-factor</em> after auditioning as solo artists.They named the band Rhythmix but a few weeks later found out that there is a band which already had that name.They then changed their name to Little Mix,which is their name to date.
           I love little Mix because this girls actually spread <em>positivity</em> out here with their songs.They are the definition of <strong>girl power</strong>,and they have some really good love songs.
